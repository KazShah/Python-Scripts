First create a new folder in local machine and select that folder as working folder in VS code.

Step-2: Cloning repo into the working folder. Tracking files and commiting changes to existing files.

1) git clone HTTP Key: Clones the git repo to local machine.
2) .git folder: to show .get folder in windows, enable hidden folder in file explorer. ls -la for linux for hidden files/folders
3) git status: gives the status of files that are new added or files that are modified
4) git add . : used to track new files. the '.' after add means to track all files in the folder.
You can also specify file name after 'add' just to track that specific file
5) git commit -m "xxx" -m "xxx" : first '-m' is for message that need to be added with each commit. second -m is for
adding any description.
6) git push: will push the cahnges to git. will ask for github login and password.
